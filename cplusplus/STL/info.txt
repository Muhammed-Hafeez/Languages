The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) consists of several components that facilitate data manipulation and algorithm implementation. Here are the main components of the C++ STL:

Containers: These are used to store collections of data. They provide different data structures for different needs.

Sequence Containers: Allow storage of elements in a linear sequence.
vector
deque
list
array
forward_list
Associative Containers: Store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value.
set
multiset
map
multimap
Unordered Associative Containers: Use hash tables for storage.
unordered_set
unordered_multiset
unordered_map
unordered_multimap
Container Adaptors: Provide a different interface for sequential containers.
stack
queue
priority_queue
Algorithms: These are a collection of functions for performing operations on the elements of containers.

Searching: find, binary_search, search
Sorting: sort, partial_sort, nth_element
Modifying: copy, swap, replace, fill
Numeric: accumulate, inner_product, adjacent_difference, partial_sum
Iterators: These provide a way to access elements of a container. Iterators are used extensively by the STL algorithms.

Input Iterator
Output Iterator
Forward Iterator
Bidirectional Iterator
Random Access Iterator
Functions and Functors: These are objects that can be called as if they are a function.

Function Objects (Functors): Objects that can be used in place of a function.
Predefined Function Objects: plus, minus, multiplies, divides, modulus, negate, etc.
Binders: bind1st, bind2nd
Function Adaptors: ptr_fun, mem_fun, mem_fun_ref
Lambda Expressions: Provide a concise way to define anonymous function objects.
Utilities: Provide utility functions and classes.

pair
tuple
swap
move
forward
make_pair
make_tuple
tie
